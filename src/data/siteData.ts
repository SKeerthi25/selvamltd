    question: "Do you offer emergency callouts across Swindon and Wiltshire?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we operate a 24/7 emergency response line for dangerous electrical faults, burning smells from consumer units, persistent tripping, power blackouts, and critical security failures. Call us directly on +44 7774 453041.",
  },
  {
    category: "CCTV Systems",
    question: "Do I have to pay a monthly subscription to view my CCTV cameras?",
    answer:
      "No. Unlike cloud-only doorbell cameras, our professional systems record locally onto an on-site surveillance-grade hard drive. You enjoy lifetime free remote streaming and push notifications on your smartphone without monthly fees.",

  {
    category: "CCTV Systems",
    question: "How long does video footage stay stored on the system?",
    answer:
      "Depending on your hard drive size (1TB, 2TB, or 4TB) and camera resolution, recordings typically overwrite after 14 to 30+ days. You can also export video clips instantly to your mobile phone or USB drive whenever required.",
  },
  {
    category: "Electrical & Lighting",
    question: "What is the difference between an old fuse board and a modern consumer unit?",
    answer:
      "Older fuse boards use rewireable wire fuses or basic MCBs that fail to detect earth leakage current (the cause of lethal electric shocks and fires). Modern 18th Edition metal consumer units feature individual RCBOs and Surge Protection Devices (SPDs) that trip within 30 milliseconds to save lives and protect sensitive electronics.",

  {
    category: "Electrical & Lighting",
    question: "Can I replace halogen downlights with energy-efficient LEDs?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We replace outdated fire-hazard halogen cans with modern sealed fire-rated LED downlights. These reduce lighting energy consumption by up to 85% and eliminate frequent blown bulbs.",
  },
  {
    category: "Quotations & Workmanship",
    question: "How do I get a quotation, and is it free?",
    answer:
      "We provide completely free, no-obligation written quotes. You can use our online multi-step quote tool, send photos on WhatsApp (+44 7774 453041), or book an on-site survey at your convenience.",

    question: "What warranty do you provide on parts and labour?",
    answer:
      "All electrical installations come with a minimum 12-month workmanship guarantee. CCTV equipment comes with 12 to 36 months manufacturer hardware warranties, depending on the chosen package.",
